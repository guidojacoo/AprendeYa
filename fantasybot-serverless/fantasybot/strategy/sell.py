"""SELL advisor: who to offload and at what price.

Safe rule: only proposes selling players NOT in your optimal XI (so it doesn't break your
lineup) and, by default, only for ONE clear, data-grounded reason — a clearly FALLING
value (trend below the threshold) → cash in before losing more.

It deliberately does NOT flag a valuable player merely for being outside today's PROBABLE
lineup: that data lags for recent signings, so "transfer risk / might leave" is a false
positive (the Aubameyang case) — and with no real transfer data we never invent it. A
cheap backup whose value is rising or stable is kept too (an appreciating asset/rotation).

EXCEPTION, opt-in via `prob_index`: when cash-on-hand is thin (`is_low_cash`), a bench
player who's very unlikely to start (probable-lineup % below `BENCH_PROB_THRESHOLD`) IS
flagged — "not playing and we need the room" is a legitimate reason to free up cash, even
without a falling trend. It only kicks in under low cash on purpose: with healthy cash
there's no rush to sell a fine, merely-benched squad player.
