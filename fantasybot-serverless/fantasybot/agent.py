"""The agent: a full review, like a human would do when logging in.

`review()` runs an attentive user's cycle:
  1) Looks at WHAT HAS CHANGED since the last connection (signings against you,
     balance...).
  2) Reviews lineup, market, flip opportunities and squad gaps.
  3) Detects buyout targets and works out WHEN to react (reminders).
  4) Keeps the week's task list (adds/completes on its own).

Returns a structured report. Firing the reminders (cronjobs) and the
notifications are built on top (see README / next steps).
